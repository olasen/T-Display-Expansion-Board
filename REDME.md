# **T-Display-Expansion-Board**


# **OVERVIEW**



Hi, I'd like to share my new project, the T-Display Expansion Board, which aims to expand your T-Display S3 with 7 additional modules.


The project was created primarily for educational, research, and hardware experimentation purposes. It focuses on expanding the s3 with seven additional modules that will enhance its usability.


IMPORTANT: This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. Using the module extension for card theft, radio signal jamming, and key duplication is illegal in most countries. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this project.
